# Kumar Notes

## Welcome

This documentation project is meant for my personal use, for everything I learn and able to document. This project is continuously under progress, and it may not include many topics, for which I am not able to spare time, and which will be added in due course.

The motive behind this, is to have an all-inclusive, yet concise reference, which is quick to go through.
